    "# CVRP Solver with Density-Based Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements an advanced solver for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using a hybrid approach that combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **KMeans Clustering**: Initial spatial partitioning of delivery points\n",
    "- **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**: Identifying high-density regions\n",
    "- **DBSCAN**: Sub-clustering within each partition for fine-grained route optimization\n",
    "- **OR-Tools**: TSP solving for route sequencing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The CVRP is a classic optimization problem where:\n",
    "- Multiple vehicles with limited capacity must serve a set of delivery points\n",
    "- Each delivery has a specific size/demand\n",
    "- The goal is to minimize total travel distance while respecting vehicle capacity constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Phase**: Learn density patterns from historical delivery data\n",
    "2. **Clustering Phase**: Partition new deliveries into spatial regions\n",
    "3. **Routing Phase**: Optimize routes within each partition\n",
    "4. **Solution Phase**: Combine individual routes into a complete solution\n",

    "- `model`: Fitted KMeans clusterer for macro-level partitioning\n",
    "- `density_info`: Dictionary storing KDE contours, DBSCAN models, and ordered centroids for each cluster\n",
    "- `subroutes`: Hierarchical dictionary organizing deliveries by cluster → contour level → DBSCAN label\n",

    "1. **Aggregate Training Data**: Collect all delivery points from multiple historical instances\n",
    "2. **Macro-Clustering**: Apply KMeans to partition space into `n_clusters` regions\n",

    "   - Compute Kernel Density Estimation over the cluster points\n",
    "   - Generate contour levels representing density gradients\n",
    "   - Identify high-density zones (≥4 nested contours)\n",
    "4. **Density-Based Separation**: Classify points into:\n",
    "   - **High-density points**: Points within ≥4 contours (urban cores, dense areas)\n",
    "   - **Low-density points**: Points outside high-density contours\n",
    "5. **Micro-Clustering (DBSCAN)**: Apply DBSCAN only to low-density points, creating sub-clusters that respect natural spatial groupings\n",
    "6. **Centroid Ordering**: Compute centroids for each DBSCAN cluster and sequence them using nearest-neighbor ordering\n",
